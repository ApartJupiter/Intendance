This is my Diploma Final Year Project on Employee Management System.
How this worked was - An admin had the rights to assign which role should be given to whom.
Power hierarchy -> Admin > Project Manager > Developer.
The Project Manager could see the amount of hours, how much progress the employee put towards their Projects.
The Manager could also assign/de-assign the worj to the developers.
